It is your employer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that their employees below the age of 16 have parental consent to use the Services.</p>
        <p>In jurisdictions where the legal working age or age requirement for parental consent is higher than the above, it is your employer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that it has gathered the necessary parental consent as required in your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>You must provide your full legal name, a valid email address, and any other required information to complete the signup process.</p>

        <p>No one individual or organization may maintain more than one account without a subscription. Extraneous accounts that are not connected to an active subscription may be deleted at Agilibo&rsquo; discretion.</p>
        <p>The subscribing organization and its users are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under its account (even when content is posted by others who have sub-accounts under your account).</p>
        <p>Agilibo is committed to continually improving and enhancing the Services and, subject to any other written agreement you may have with Agilibo, you acknowledge and agree that the specific form and/or nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice and Agilibo may cease providing the Services (or any specific features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Agilibo&rsquo; sole discretion, without prior notice to you.</p>
        <p>You may stop using the Services at any time. For users within an organization that use Agilibo, contact your organization&rsquo;s Agilibo Administrator to request the removal of your user account and anonymization or deletion of any personal data (if required).

        <p>A trial account may be set up to allow you to test the functionality of Agilibo&rsquo; Services. These accounts may include some limitations compared to Accounts tied to an active paid subscription.</p>
        <p>Trial accounts that do not upgrade to a subscription at the end of the trial period are automatically downgraded to an Inactive Account.</p>
        <p>Inactive Accounts are accounts that have not been associated with a paid subscription for Services and therefore do not receive access to those services.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
        <p>For paid Service accounts, Agilibo maintains ongoing backup data of its user accounts for a period of six (6) months. Backup data that is older than six months is routinely erased from the system.</p>
        <p>Data stored pertaining to free accounts is held for a period of six (6) months before being completely purged from the system.

        <p>Payment, Access, and Account Updates</p>
        <p>You agree to pay Agilibo all fees set forth in each agreement. &nbsp;All fees will be billed as indicated in each agreement.

        <p>For our monthly subscription plans, a valid credit card is required to commence services. &nbsp;We will charge you a monthly fee based on your account type and number of active users. The Service is billed in advance for each month, and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, nor refunds made should you not use the Service during a period of time when your account is open. &nbsp;No exceptions will be made. You can archive users at any time.</p>
        <p>Should you add or archive users, upgrade or downgrade your account type, your credit card will be charged your new billing rate on your renewal date.</p>
        <p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Agilibo does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
        <p>Modifications to the Service and Fees</p>
        <p>You alone are responsible for the proper cancellation of your account. You may cancel your account by contacting Agilibo support team.</p>

        <p>For annual and multi-year agreements, the cancellation clause in each specific agreement will apply.</p>
